# PDF-AS Server

[PDF-AS](https://www.a-sit.at/egiz/e-government-innovationszentrum-egiz/)
provides various services and tools around signing PDF documents.

DBP has prepared a project for [Qualified Signatures](#pdf-as-server-for-qualified-signatures)
and one for [Advanced Signatures](#pdf-as-server-for-advanced-signatures).

## PDF-AS Server for Qualified Signatures

This project consists of a
[pdf-as-web](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/e-government-innovation-center-egiz/solution/pdf) installation,
default configuration for pdf-as, pdf-as-web as well as tomcat and focuses on
providing a signature service that can sign PDFs using PAdES via a
SOAP interface and https://www.handy-signatur.at as well as verify those signatures
via [MOA-SPSS](https://apps.egiz.gv.at/handbooks/moa-spss/handbook/handbook/index.html)
