## The Logo
*Hier kommt das Logo hin*

The DBP logo is preferably placed in the upper right corner or in the middle [[Fig. 1]](#fig1).

### The text
The text on the right side of the Logo consists of two parts. A headline "digital blueprint" and a subheading.
The headline should never change. The subheading can change depending on the use. The default subheading is "a university toolbox". 
Read more under [Adapt the Text](#adapt-the-text).

### Background
The logo is not allowed to use on a different background than black or white.
The correct file depending on the background must be used: *logo_white.svg* [[Fig. 1]](#fig1) or *logo_black.svg* [[Fig. 2]](#fig2).

### Whitespace
The logo must always be placed with sufficient padding. For the exact paddings see [Fig. 3](#fig3). 
For easier usage the logo in the file has exact these surrounding paddings.

### Size
#### Print
The minimal size of the logo is xxx cm.
If the logo should be placed smaller than xxx cm than only the squares should be displayed.
The minimal presentation of the squares are xxx cm.

#### Digital 
The minimal size of the logo is xxx px.
If the logo should be placed smaller than xxx px than only the squares should be displayed.
The minimal presentation of the squares are xxx px.

### Monochrom
There is also a monochrom set provided of the logo.
Depending on the background the correct file must be used: *logo_monochrom_white.svg* [[Fig. 1]](#fig1) or *logo_monochrom_black.svg* [[Fig. 2]](#fig2).

### Adaption
The logo can adjust depending on some uses. To adjust the logo we recommend the vector based open source program [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/de/).
If a logo is adjusted, the versions for both backgrounds(white, black) and also the monochrom versions(white, black) have to be created.

#### Adjust the Text
The headline on the right side of the logo should never change. The subheading can change depending on the usecase. The default subheading is "a university toolbox".
If the subheading changes, it should be lowercase and should start under the "a" of digit*a*l [[Fig. 1]](#fig1). It should short and formative and should not too long.
The maximal length can see in [Fig. 1](#fig1).

##### How to adjust the text
Make sure you have installed the [fonts](../fonts/) on your working device.
Open the initial file *logo_white.pdf* in Inkscape. Double-click on the subheading till you get a text cursor. Change the text.
Save it named *yourapplication_logo_white* as pdf, svg, eps in an own folder called youraplication in the logo folder.

Repeat this process with *logo_black.pdf* *logo_monochrom_white.pdf* and *logo_monochrom_black.pdf*.


#### Icons
If the logo is used in an application, which has an app icon[[Apps]](../apps/), the logo can be extended with that icon [[Fig. 1]](#fig1)
by placing the app-icon in front of the squares and in the middle of the first square. The padding of this icon shouldn't extend the padding declared in [Appicons](../apps/#Appicons).

##### How to adjust the icons
Make sure you have installed the [fonts](../fonts/) on your working device.
Open the initial file *logo_white.pdf* in Inkscape. Place the previously created icon in the middle on the rightmost top square.
The color of the icon depends on the background of the logo file. 
If the file is for black background then the icon should have the color `#000000` and if the file is for white background the app icon should have the color `#ffffff`.
Save it named *yourapplication_logo_white* as pdf, svg, eps in an own folder called youraplication in the logo folder.

Repeat this process with *logo_black.pdf* *logo_monochrom_white.pdf*, *logo_monochrom_black.pdf*, *logo_small_white.pdf*, logo_small_black.pdf, *logo_monochrom_small_white.pdf* and logo_monochrom_small_black.pdf.


### Files
All variations of the logo, all design elements are given in the following file formats:
svg, pdf, eps.

The following logo versions initially exist:
- logo_white
- logo_black
- logo_small_white
- logo_small_black
- logo_monochrom_white
- logo_monochrom_black
- logo_monochrom_small_white
- logo_monochrom_small_black

For each adjusted logo exists a folder *YourAplicationName*.
In these folder exists the same files with *YourAplicationName_* prefix.
