# Apps
The branding for a specific app consists of three parts: the name, the friendly name and an app icon.

<figure id="fig1" style="width:100%;">
    <img src="../assets/appheader_example.svg" alt="App header example" style="max-width:100%; box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px grey; background-color:white; margin:auto;">
    <figcaption align = "center">
        <b>Fig. 1: App header example</b>
    </figcaption>
</figure>


## App name
The app name is a creative almost unique title. It should be recognizable and simple.
E.g.: mono, esign, formalize, greenlight, check-in... It also should not exceed a maxlength of 15 characters and should have a minimum of 4 characters.

## App friendly name
Because the app name can be creative and brandend we need an explanation of it. The friendly name of an app is a description of the app name. 
E.g.: mono - digital payment service, esign - electronic signature service, formalize - electronic forms. greenlight - a ticket system, check-in - a contact tracing system...
It also should not exceed a maxlength of 30 characters and should have a minimum of 10 characters.

## App icon
An app icon consists of two parts: the icon itself and the dbp squares behind them.

##### How to adjust the icons
Make sure you have installed the [fonts](../fonts/) on your working device.
Open the initial file *dbp_logo_on_white.pdf* in Inkscape. Place the previously created icon in the middle on the rightmost top square.
The color of the icon depends on the background of the logo file.
If the file is for black background then the icon should have the color `#222120` and if the file is for white background the app icon should have the color `#ffffff`.
Save it named *dbp_yourapplication_logo_on_white* as pdf, svg, eps in an own folder called `youraplication` in the logo folder.

Repeat this process with the all other pages and export them to the appropriate files.
